# Neural Style Transfer
This repository aims to figure out the workings of Neural Style Transfer, a popular method to combine two different images based on the content of one and style of another.

# Progress So Far
I am using the tensorflow model for style transfer but i definitely see myself implementing it from scratch in pytorch in the future. 

You can find the arbitrary style transfer model over [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization).
